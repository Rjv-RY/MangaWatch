# MangaWatch:Backend

## A Primer/What You'll need

The Backend is the heart and soul of this application. It's a somewhat complicated process to get it all set up. Here's what you will need.

- Java installed(I use version 21.0.5). 
- An IDE you can use (I use Eclipse because Java but VSCode would work fine).
- Docker Desktop to run a container for the PostgreSql.
- A Mangadex account with access to their API (free, works well)
- And a lot of duct tape solutions and hope.
- I use Maven here, my pom.xml will show.
- Knowhow of a tool like Postman or Curl to send requests (I used Postman)
